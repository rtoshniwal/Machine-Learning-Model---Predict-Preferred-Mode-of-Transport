# Machine-Learning-Model---Predict-Preferred-Mode-of-Transport

Problem Statement

This project requires you to understand what mode of transport employees prefers to commute to their office. The attached data 'Cars.csv' includes employee information about their mode of transport as well as their personal and professional details like age, salary, work exp. We need to predict whether or not an employee will use Car as a mode of transport. Also, which variables are a significant predictor behind this decision.

Create multiple models and explore how each model performs using appropriate model performance metrics
-KNN 
-Naive Bayes
-Logistic Regression
-Apply both bagging and boosting modeling procedures to create 2 models and compare its accuracy with the best model of the above step.

Summarize your findings from the exercise in a concise yet actionable note.
